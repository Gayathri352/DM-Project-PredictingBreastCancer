# Breast Cancer Detection Using Machine Learning

This project applies supervised machine learning techniques to accurately classify tumors as benign or malignant using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.

---

## Objective

To build, evaluate, and compare multiple classification algorithms on medical diagnostic data and identify the best model for predicting breast cancer.

---

## Dataset

- Source: `sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer()`
- Samples: 569
- Features: 30 numeric attributes (mean, standard error, worst of various cell properties)
- Target: 0 = Malignant, 1 = Benign

---

## Techniques Used

- Data Preprocessing with `StandardScaler`
- Dimensionality Reduction with `PCA`
- Class Imbalance Handling with `SMOTE`
- Classification Algorithms:
  - Decision Tree
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Neural Network (MLPClassifier)
- Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, AUC
